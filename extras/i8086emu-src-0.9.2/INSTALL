Howto install the i8086emu:

Basic Installation
==================

* so far a "./configure && make && make install" should do it for you
  (of course you need to be root to do "make install" depending on
  install prefix)
* for not making the gui version try "./configure usegtk=0"
* for changing the install prefix do "./configure --prefix=/foo/bar"
* cfg will be placed in "~/.emu.cfg"


Uninstall
=========

* dude don't do it ;op *hrhr* ... if you're really sure that you have no 
  need for our emu ... do "make uninstall".
